# Desk-Reservation project

Verteo's Tip Top Tupperware is used to store syringes. Our employees work from two offices. Desks in offices 1 and 2 are occupied by traveling salespeople who are rarely in the office. To be more efficient, we are instituting hotelling and employees will use Salesforce to reserve their desks when they need them.
 

Please Note:  Our salespeople are very social and like to pick desks to sit near their friends.


Please refer to Desk-Reservation.pdf for more in depth details.
